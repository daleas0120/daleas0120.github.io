Hello World!

I am a condensed matter physicist researching magnetic materials.  I also research explainable and trustworthy AI, and computer vision.  

My work has applications in <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20220238537A1/en">spintronics</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.171392756.66802879/v1">black-box model exploration</a>, Monte-Carlo simulation, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1117/12.3015657">data domain gap analysis</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP/tree/main/Connecting_MonteCarlo_to_ModernAI">physics education</a>.
