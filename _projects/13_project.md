The history of the physics department is deeply entwined with a 1970's era Bruker EPR like this one from the University of Oregon

complete with a nearly identical console for controlling the system.  Unfortunately, the CRT display in our system died about half-way through my Ph.D. studies.  As the console is still our only way of accessing the EPR, this meant the entire system became nonfunctional.

Since I needed an extra project to think about, I added resuscitaing the system to my list of projects.  Spoiler: I have not yet been successful. But in the spirit of academic transparency here is a list of things we have tried that have not worked so far.
